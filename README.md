# ANN-Classification-Churn

This project utilizes Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Classification to analyze a dataset and determine customer churn rates based on various factors such as geographical location, account balance, and more.

Key features of the implementation include:
- **OneHotEncoder**: Used for vectorizing categorical data to ensure compatibility with the model.
- **TensorBoard**: Integrated to monitor accuracy and other metrics across epochs for better insight into the training process.
